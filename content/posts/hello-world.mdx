# Hello World!

Welcome to my new blog! I'm excited to share this space with you. This platform is built with modern web technologies to ensure a fast, accessible, and enjoyable reading experience.

## Tech Stack

This blog is a static site generated using:

- **Next.js** (App Router) for the framework
- **MDX** for writing content with React components
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **TypeScript** for type safety

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

1.  Software Development & Engineering
2.  My personal projects and experiments
3.  Tips and tutorials on modern web stacks

Stay tuned for more updates!
